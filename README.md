# hello-world
This is my first repository. It is where I store scratch files before I start a project.
My name is Jeremy and I am a recent graduate working in marketing research. I have always been curious about coding, but ultimately went to school for Marketing. My goal is to get into space through fun projects and eventually apply my experience for becoming a data scientist.
